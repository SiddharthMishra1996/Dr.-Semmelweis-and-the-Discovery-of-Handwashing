# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing
This project is about the importance of washing of hands by doctors during childbirth. Dr Ignaz Semmelweis (a Hungarian physician who worked at Vienna General Hospital) observed that in early 1840s around 10% of delivering women died due to childbed fever, a deadly disease which affects the women that have just given birth and the most probable cause of which is the contaminated hands of doctors delivering the babies. In this project we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the wrongful prcedures followed by the hospital staff during that time and the importance of handwashing.
